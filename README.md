# Software for a DVD Kiosk
A software I wrote to read data and use it to update its inventory made using a Binary Search Tree
This software reads from a file containing transaction data, and uses that data to add, remove, rent, or return DVDs.
I think this software can be quite useful for an actual DVD Kiosk or a similar small store with some changes.
The inventory for the Kiosk is made using a custom Binary Search Tree I created.
You can find the java files in Rebox_kioske_project4/src/RedBox/.
There is another file called RedBox_Test where I made test cases for my methods.
